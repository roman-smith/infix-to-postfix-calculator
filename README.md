# infix-to-postfix-calculator
Class: CSE 205 - Assignment: 4
Description: I wrote this Java program from scratch for my CSE 205 class to practice and demonstrate my skills in creating and implementing a stack data structure using object-oriented programming. The program asks the user to input a mathematical expression to evaluate using infix notation, performs a preliminary check of the number and order of parentheses, converts the expression to postfix notation, and then evaluates the expression. The StackNode.java file represents the general class for a node on the stack, and is not data-type specific which allows us to use the same class file for any data structure we want. The class contains the information stored by the node and the reference to the next node on the stack. The Stack.java file represents the general class for a stack of an unspecified data type. Assn4.java runs the main method and instantiates two stacks, one defined as type Character and one defined as type Double. These stacks are used to perform all of the required validations and processing of the user's expression.
